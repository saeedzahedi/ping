This is an implementation of ping function using boost/asio library. It's based on an example  provided with boost/asio which implements a ping program:

bool ping(uint32_t address, uint8_t count, uint16_t timer_milliseconds)

The parameters include:
- ping address with hex32 format
- count times the request is sent
- timer-milliseconds is the time between consecutive requests

It returns true if half the requests or more get replied.

ping.cpp provides a typical call for the function.
